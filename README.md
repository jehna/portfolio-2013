# Portfolio 2013
> My portfolio website(s) from 2013

With this portfolio I was able to land 6/7 interviews I applied to.

## Two sites

As with any marketing, you should be able to customize your message specifically
to the receiver.

This portfolio site has two distinct areas, which you find below:

### 1. Frontend programmer's portfolio

**Tag:** [`frontend-programmer-portfolio`][frontend-programmer-portfolio]

This is the "main" portfolio, which also included my printable pdf CV.

#### Live site

This part of the site is still "live" at the following URL:

http://jehna.github.io/portfolio-2013/


### 2. Game programmer portfolio

**Tag:** [`gaming-portfolio`][gaming-portfolio]

Portfolio showing my success at game development.
